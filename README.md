# Fruit-Recognition-Quantity-and-Quality-Estimation-Using-Robotic-Vision-System
This project focuses on utilizing a robotic vision system to recognize various types of fruits, estimate their quantity, and assess their quality. Leveraging Python, TensorFlow, and the open-source dataset Fruits 360, I trained a machine learning model to perform these tasks with high accuracy.
